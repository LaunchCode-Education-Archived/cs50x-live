[Module 7](../..)

# Problem Set: Pset 7

### Synopsis

In this problem set, your goal is to implement your own version this site:

https://finance.cs50.net/

aka *C$50 Finance*. Your first step is to play around with it for a couple minutes and get a feel for it. Do that now!

Your site will use a PHP backend with a MySQL database to store user accounts and and their stock portfolios.

### How to submit 

When finished, compress your project into a zip file:

```nohighlight
$ zip pzet7.zip pset7
```

Then download the zip file from your IDE.

On Vocareum, upload `pset7.zip` into the assignment titled **Problem Set 7: Finance**.

### Guidance

The structure of this project is very similar to the project you created in the [Greetings studio](../studios/greetings), so you should already have some familiarity with the various building blocks of the application. If you have not yet completed Greetings, we recommend you go back and do that first.
