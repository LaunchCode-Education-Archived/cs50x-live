# Exercise: Stylish Favorite Websites

Remember that HTML page we made earlier, with our 3 favorites websites? We went ahead and spruced it up with some styling:

Our new [favorites.html](./favorites.html) links to a stylesheet called [styles.css](./styles.html). You should put all your styles in here. We've already gotten started for you with a few of them.
