# Exercise : Codecademy / Javascript

To give you some practice writing JavaScript code, we are going to send you over to do some exercises on Codecademy.

The course we are sending you to is designed for beginners to coding in general (aka not you anymore!), so we are going to drop you into one of the later lessons, the
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-9Sgpi/0/1" target="_blank">Arrays and Objects lesson</a>, which will give you some exercises on javascript arrays, before introducing Objects. 

Feel free to go back to the previous lesson if you need more guidance on the Arrays section.

After Arrays and Objects, do the next lesson, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-3bmfN/0/1?curriculum_id=506324b3a7dffd00020bf661" target="_blank">Contact List</a>.

Between the two lessons, there are a total of 25 (short) exercises. This should take you 2 - 3 hours overall. If you have spent more than that, feel free to take a break from this and move on to the rest of the Class 1 Prep Work.
