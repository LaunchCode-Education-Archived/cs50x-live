# Class 1

### Before Class
For homework, you should have done [Prep for Class 1](../class1-prep)

### During Class

For prep work you learned about Pointers! Today we'll review what pointers are, how to use them, and when to use them. 

For studio, you will do a problem that is very similar to part of Pset4. You do not necessarily need to use pointers to solve the problem, so don't let that confuse you.

**Today's Schedule:**

1. Lecture / Q&A on the following topics
  * pointers
  * malloc
2. Studio: [Word Grid Stretch](../studios/word-grid-stretch)

### Homework
1. [Class 2 Prep](../class2-prep) 
2. Get started on on [Problem Set 4](../problem-set).
