# Studio: Lovely Rect<3ngle

In a file called `rectangle.c` write a program that "draws" a rectangle made of hearts `<3` on the console. 
Your program should prompt the user for a width and a height, and then print the corresponding rectangle:

```nohighlight
$ ./rectangle
Width: 8
Height: 3
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
```

You may find it helpful to refer back to your solution to this studio when you work on Mario in the problem set (hint, hint, wink, wink).

*You can grab a copy of these instructions from Helpful Resources <a href="../../../../../../../helpful-resources/modules/module-1.html#class-2-studio-lovely-rectangle" target="_blank">here</a>. They are formatted as comments so that you can put it at the top of your program in the CS50 IDE. Remember the compiler ignores any comments, so this won't affect your program! You can start writing your code right after the comments.
