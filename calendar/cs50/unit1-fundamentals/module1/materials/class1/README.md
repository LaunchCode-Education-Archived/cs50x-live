##### [Module 1](../..) 

# Class 1

### Before Class
For homework you should have done: [Prep for Class 1](../class1-prep)

### During Class
Ok, so there was a lot of information in the Prep for Class 1. During class today, we'll go over the main concepts, and try to address questions that you have. The studio for today should help reinforce those concepts. For that, you will work together in pairs (or groups of 3) to write a program for an imaginary donut shop. 

In class, we'll do these things:

1. Q&A on the following topics:
  * getting user input
  * printing things
  * math in C
2. [Studio: Donuts](../studios/donuts)

### Homework

* [Class 2 Prep](../class2-prep)
* Check out the page for [Problem Set 1](../problem-set). After today's class, you should be in a great position to complete Problem Set 1 / Water.
