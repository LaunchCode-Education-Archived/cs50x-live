##### Module 1

# Exercise: Percent

Write a program that asks the user for two floating-point numbers, and then computes the ratio between 
them as a percent.

For example:

```
$ ./percent 
float please: 0.5
float please: 2
25.000000 percent
```

```
$ ./percent 
float please: 3
float please: 2
150.000000 percent
```

```
$ ./percent 
float please: 1
float please: 1.5
66.666664 percent
```

Notice how because of the inherent imprecision of floating point numbers, that last value is slightly wrong. 
Should be `66.666667 percent`
