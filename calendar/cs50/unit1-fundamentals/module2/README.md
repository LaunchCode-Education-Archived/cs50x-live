# Module 2

**Pre-reqs:** You should have completed [Module 1](../module1)

#### Synopsis 

In Module 2, we will learn:
* how to write our own functions
* how to inspect and manipulate strings
* how to accept user input as "command line arguments"
* learn about some new data types like `char` and `array`

These skills will eventually allow us to do some real cryptography (the art of writing or solving secret codes) -- we'll use code to become codebreakers!

By the end of this module you will have completed [Problem Set 2](./materials/problem-set).
