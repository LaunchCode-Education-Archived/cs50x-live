# Module 0

### Synopsis
Module 0 is meant to introduce you to CS50x, and to give you the foundation you'll need before you start programming. You'll meet David Malan, the Harvard professor for this class, and some of the teaching fellows (or TFs) from Harvard. They will introduce binary numbers and algorithms, important concepts you'll need to understand in order to think like a computer programmer. By the end of the module, you will be familiar with pseudocode, and a graphical language called Scratch, which you'll use to complete Problem Set 0. 

You should complete *all* of Module 0 before coming to the first day of class. If you finish this, and have plenty of time to spare, we've included a few more resources that we encourage you to check out before the class begins. 

So without further ado, let the learning begin!

##### Lecture
Task | Resource Type| Link | Instructions
--------------|------|------|-------------
Watch | Lecture | <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=zFenJJtAEzE" target="_blank">Week 0</a> | Your first task is to watch the first lecture! There will be some Harvard-specific information in there (and some information about the class at Yale), so feel free to fast forward through that if you want.

##### Binary and ASCII
Task | Resource Type| Link | Instructions
--------------|------|------|-------------
Read | Lecture Notes| <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/0/w/notes0w/notes0w.html#binary" target="_blank">Week 1 / Binary</a> | Read over the portion of the lecture notes that talk about binary. Don't worry too much if this doesn't immediately click for you; mostly, it is just good to have an idea of what's going on in the computer at a lower level. <br>Stop when you get to the *Algorithms* header.
Watch | Short| <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hacBFrgtQjQ&index=7&list=PLhQjrBD2T380dhmG9KMjsOQogweyjEeVQ" target="_blank">Binary</a> | Watch this short that will explain binary numbers in more detail.
Watch | Short | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPlR4eMMCmI&index=5&list=PLhQjrBD2T380dhmG9KMjsOQogweyjEeVQ" target="_blank">ASCII</a> | Watch this short about ASCII. Again, don't worry if you don't understand this completely. We'll revisit this again later in the class.

#####Lecture
Task | Resource Type| Link | Instructions
--------------|------|------|-------------
Watch | Lecture | <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=UuFWYOnHwGM" target="_blank">Week 0, continued</a> | Watch the week's second lecture. The class activities, such as the PB & J sandwich exercise, are somewhat silly, but actually do provide a good illustration of how to think like a programmer. There will be some portion of the lecture dedicated to his visit to Yale, so feel free to fast forward through these parts (for example, minutes 25:30-27:30).

##### Algorithms and Pseudocode
Task | Resource Type| Link | Instructions
--------------|------|------|-------------
Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/0/w/notes0w/notes0w.html#algorithms" target="_blank">Week 1 / Algorithms</a> | Read over the notes from the first lecture about "Algorithms", and optionally rewatch this portion of the lecture. Although we aren't writing code yet, this is an important step toward thinking like a programmer. <br>Stop when you get to the *Syllabus* header.
Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/0/f/notes0f/notes0f.html#algorithms" target="_blank">Week 1, continued / Algorithms, PB & J Demonstration</a> | Read over the notes section about Algorithms and the PB & J exercise. <br> Stop when you get to the *Yale Introduction* header.
Watch | Short |  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFLczUUHWNw&index=1&list=PLhQjrBD2T380dhmG9KMjsOQogweyjEeVQ" target="_blank">Algorithms</a> | Watch this short that explains what an algorithm is, and why this concept is so essential to programming. 
Read | Resource | <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/software-engineering-basics/what-is-pseudo-coding" target="_blank">What is Pseudocoding?</a> | Read this article about pseudocode from the Viking Code School. Throughout the article they will reference other parts of their curriculum - don't worry about that (though feel free to check it out if you're interested!). 
Read | Resource | <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/software-engineering-basics/the-elements-of-pseudocode" target="_blank">The Elements of Pseudocode</a> | Continue on to the next section, which talks about the foundational components of pseudocode and code. 
Read / Do | Resource | <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/software-engineering-basics/practice-with-pseudo-coding" target="_blank">Practice with Pseudocoding</a> | Try solving some problems by writing out solutions in pseudocode. 
Do | Exercise | <a href="http://mgoadric.github.io/csci150/homework/origami.html" target="_blank">Dinosaur Origami</a> | *This is optional*. <br> This is a fun exercise you can do to practice your pseudocoding skills, and amuse some family and/or friends. This exercise was taken from a different class, so ignore some of the references to the class. You can also ignore the "Evaluation" or "What to Hand In" parts.

##### Scratch
Task | Resource Type| Link | Instructions
--------|------|--------------|---------
Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/0/f/notes0f/notes0f.html#source_code_and_scratch" target="_blank">Source Code and Scratch</a> | Review these notes from the lecture. This will give you a brief glimpse of the programming language C, and Scratch, which is a graphical language you'll use for Problem Set 0.
Watch | Walkthrough | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLhQjrBD2T383nc2LUdF5XWbyrsqiYy4nq&v=tveoFN0NHE0" target="_blank">Week 0 Walkthroughs</a> | Watch this series of videos where David brings Scratch to life. You should watch them in order (they are properly sequenced in Youtube). You may notice that these Scratch programs were also referenced in the lecture notes.

###Now you're ready for the first day of class! The best place to see the course materials is by viewing the [Course Calendar](..)

##### Bonus Resources!
Waiting for the first day of class, but can't wait to get coding? Try out the these resources, which will introduce you to a programming language called Javascript. We'll return to Javascript later in CS50x, but for now, consider it good coding practice:

1. <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming" target="_blank">Khan Academy's Introduction to Javascript: Drawing and Animation</a>
2. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript" target="_blank">Codeacademy's Javascript Track</a> 

These are *completely optional*, but will definitely benefit you as you begin CS50x, so we encourage everyone to at least try one of these.
