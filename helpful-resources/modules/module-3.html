<pre><code>/**
  * Filename: wordgrid.c
  * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module3/studios/wordgrid
  * 
  * Recall that you can represent multi-dimensional data with nested arrays. 
  * For example, you can represent a grid of things as an array of (arrays of things).
  * In fact, an array of strings is one such example; since a string is actually just an array of chars, 
  * an array of strings is an array of (arrays of chars).
  * Let's explore this by writing a program that receives three 3-character strings (in other words a grid of 9 chars),
  * and prints the grid to the console, with each word in its own column, like so:
  * 
  * Example:
  * $ ./wordgrid sun yes ear
  * sye
  * uea
  * nsr
  * 
  * Notice how each word is written downwards, rather than across.
  * 
  * First you'll want to perform some validation:
  * Make sure the user provided exactly 3 additional command-line arguments 
  * (in addition to the name of the program itself).
  * Make sure each of those arguments is exactly 3 characters-long. (Use strlen())
  * After validating, you can go about printing the grid.
  * 
  * Note that you can access the elements of a nested array using multiple brackets, i.e. [][]. 
  * For example, if words looks like:
  * 
  * [ "sun", "yes", "ear" ]
  * , then:
  *
  * words[0][0] evaluates to "sun"[0] which evaluates to 's'
  * words[2][1] evaluates to "ear"[1] which evaluates to 'a'

*/
int main(void)</code></pre>
<p>This studio is broken into 4 parts, which can be copied to the top of your file so that you can complete each part.   </p>
<ul>
<li>PART 1: You will copy the text *<em>(there are no asterisks `</em><code>preceding the code that will be copied to the file)** and save it in a file called</code>makefile`, do not use an extension.  </li>
<li>PART 2: You will save in a file called <code>mult.h</code> (for the function prototype). </li>
<li>PART 3: You will save in a file called <code>mult.c</code> (for the function implementation) </li>
<li>
<p>PART 4: You will save in a file called <code>expt.c</code>.  The starter code is provided in PART 4 *<em>(there are no asterisks `</em>` preceding the code that will be copied to the file)**.  If you need help please ask! :smile:  </p>
<pre><code>/**
* 
* Save All Files in Folder: ~/workspace/module3/studios/multiplication_and_exponents 
* 
* In this studio, you will be writing code that performs multiplication and exponents recursively.
* Since these two functions are separate from each other, we will use separate files for them.   
* As a starting point you are provided with some files for the exponentiation function. 
* expt.c includes starter code for the exponentiation function as well as some tests for 
* multiplication and exponentiation in a main method.
* 
* 
* PART 1:
* File: makefile
* Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module3/studios/multiplication_and_exponents
* 
* Copy the two lines below in a file called makefile (Do not add an extension, just name it makefile exactly)

  all:
          g++ expt.c mult.c mult.h -o expt
* 
* If you try to run it you'll see that there are some issues:
*      ~/workspace/module3/studios/multiplication_and_exponents $ make
*      g++ expt.c mult.c mult.h -o expt
*      g++: error: mult.c: No such file or directory
*      g++: error: mult.h: No such file or directory
* 
* The first line attempts to make the program. The next line shows what the makefile is trying to do: 
* compile a program that consists of three files, mult.c, mult.h, and expt.c. Unfortunately we are missing 
* those files: expt.c, mult.c and mult.h. (You will be given the starter code for expt.c in part 4)
* 
*/</code></pre>
<pre><code>/**
* PART 2:
* File: mult.h
* Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module3/studios/multiplication_and_exponents
* 
* Your first task will be to create those files. Let's start with `mult.h`. 
* This is the header file for the multiplication function, and should 
* include the function prototype. A prototype defines what a function uses for its inputs and 
* outputs, but does not define what the function does. It is used to tell other parts of your 
* program what kinds of functions are available for use. To keep things simple, our multiplication 
* function will focus on integers. 
*
* Our function should take two integers as input and return an integer as output. This should 
* be enough information to construct your prototype.
* Believe it or not, the header file is now complete! It may seem silly to have only a single line of code in the 
* header file, but for this example it is sufficient. More complex programs will require more complex header 
* files, but this is fine for now.
*
*/</code></pre>
<pre><code>/**
* PART 3:
* File: mult.c
* Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module3/studios/multiplication_and_exponents
* 
* Let's move on to mult.c. This file should contain the entire multiplication function. Fortunately you have already 
* written the function definition - that's what the prototype is! Go ahead and copy it into the mult.c file.
* 
* All that's left now is to write the function body - how do we want our multiplication function to behave? 
* It would be easy to use the multiplication operator (*) and call it a day, but we're going to give you some 
* restrictions to make this a little bit more challenging. Specifically, you are not allowed to use the multiplication operator. 
* You should perform multiplication using repeated addition instead. Also, you should accomplish this using recursion. 
* That means loops are not allowed for this studio. Your multiplication function should be able to handle both positive 
* and negative integers. To make things easier, focus on only positive integers first. Once you are satisfied that 
* multiplication works for positive values, see if you can tweak your code to make it work with negative values as well. 
* 
* As always, it is important to test your code. It may be a good idea to write a simple main method in mult.c that 
* you can use to test your mult function. 
*
* Hint: it may be useful to create a second (perhaps non-recursive) function that checks whether the integers are 
* positive or negative and proceeds accordingly. Be sure to ask for help if you get stuck!

<pre><code>/**
* 
* PART 4:
* File: expt.c
* Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module3/studios/multiplication_and_exponents
* 
* Copy the text below in a file called expt.c
* 
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 //TODO: Write a recursive function that computes exponents.
 //This function will rely upon your multiplication function, so you should do that first!
 int expt(int x, int y) {
     //Your code here
 }

int main() {
    //Test multiplication:
    printf("2 * 2 = %i", mult(2, 2));
    printf("3 * 9 = %i", mult(3, 9));
    printf("-3 * 9 = %i", mult(-3, 9));
    printf("3 * -9 = %i", mult(3, -9));
    printf("-3 * -9 = %i", mult(-3, -9));

    //Test exponentiation:
    printf("2^8 = %i", expt(2, 8)); //should be 256
    printf("2^3 = %i", expt(2, 3)); //should be 8
    printf("(-2)^3 = %i", expt(-2, 3)); //should be -8
}
* 
* Once you are satisfied with your multiplication function, it is time to 
* turn our attention to exponentiation. Exponentiation can be thought of as repeated multiplication, much like 
* multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition. Like with the mult function, however, you are faced with 
* some restrictions. The multiplication operator is still not allowed. Instead you should use the recursive mult 
* function that you wrote. In order to do this, we need to tell the exponentiation function what the multiplication 
* function looks like. We can do this by referring to the header file that we created.
* 
* Header files are referenced with the #include statement. So to include our header file in expt.c, we would type 
*   #include "mult.c" 
* 
* Go ahead and add this to the expt.c file now.
* 
* You are now ready to use your multiplication function to compute exponents. Your solution should be recursive, 
* so loops are still not allowed. Make sure to use your mult function to perform multiplication! Anywhere that 
* you would normally use * should be replaced with a function call to mult.
* You should now be able to use make to run the provided test cases and check your work. Notice that for expt, 
* the base (the first number) can be negative, but the exponent (the second number) cannot.
