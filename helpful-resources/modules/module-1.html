<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">/**
  * Filename: donuts.c
  * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module1/studios/donuts
  * 
  * Write a program which greets the user, introduces the flavor of the day, and 
  * takes the user's order . 
  * 
  * Taking their order involves asking two questions: 
  * "How many donuts?" and "How much do you want to pay?"
  * Finally, inform the user of the total cost of their order. 
  * Don't forget to include sales-tax, which is, let's say, 5%.
  * 
  * Example:
  *      $ ./donuts
  *      Welcome to the Loop Hole!
  *      Today's Manager's Special is:
  *      Crunch Jelly: A traditional jelly donut in which the jelly filling is made entirely of Capn' Crunch Berries (Just Berries)
  *      How many would you like? 3.33333
  *      How much would you like to pay per donut (suggested price is $4.35 each)? 2.5
  *      Ok, let me prepare that for you....
  *      After tax, your total is: $8.74999125 
  *      Thank you for snacking! Loop back around here soon!
  * 
  * Remember, don't worry about rounding and your result may have a slightly
  * different number of decimal places than the example program due to imprecision.

<h3 id="class-2-studio-guess">Class 2 Studio: Guess</h3>
<p>This studio will be made up of three separate programs, (<code>guess.c</code>, <code>guess5.c</code>, and <code>guessfive.c</code>) The instructions for all 3 programs are included here. You will start with the first program <code>guess.c</code> and follow the directions for the other 2 programs.</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight"> /**
  * Filename: guess.c
  * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module1/studios/guess
  * 
  * Part 1
  * Write a "guessing game" program that allows the user to guess a number between 1 and 10.
  * The program should continuously reprompt the user until they get the correct answer.
  * 
  * You can simply decide on a "correct answer" and hard-code that number into your code. 
  * Supposing for example that you decide to make 4 the correct answer, you will probably have a line like this:
  *     
  *     int answer = 4;
  * 
  * Notice that you'll need to keep track of how many guesses have happened so far, so that you can properly print "Guess #&lt;n&gt;"
  * Example: 
  * 
  *     I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10. Can you guess what it is?
  *     Guess #1: 5
  *     Wrong!
  *     Guess #2: 9
  *     Wrong!
  *     Guess #3: 4
  *     Correct!
  * 
  */</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight"> /**
  * Part 2
  * Filename: guess5.c
  * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module1/studios/guess5
  * 
  * Write another program called guess5, which gives the user only 5 chances to get the answer:
  * This should only involve some minor tweaking, so you can make a copy of your guess.c file using the cp command:
  *        $ cp guess.c guess5.c
  * Open up guess5.c and make changes there.
  *
  * Example:
  *     $ ./guess5
  *     I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10. Can you guess what it is?
  *     Guess #1: 8
  *     Wrong!
  *     Guess #2: 5
  *     Wrong!
  *     Guess #3: 1
  *     Wrong!
  *     Guess #4: 7
  *     Wrong!
  *     Guess #5: 6
  *     Wrong!
  *     Sorry, you ran out of guesses.
  * 
  */</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight"> /**
  * PART 3 
  * Filename: guessfive.c
  * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module1/studios/guessfive
  *
  * Most likely, you've been using a while loop so far. Let's now refactor, and use a for loop instead, just for kicks.  
  * Write another program in a file called guessfive.c, which behaves exactly like guess5, but is implemented with a for loop. 
  * (But if you did use a for loop in guess5, then use a while loop here.)
  *

<h3 id="class-2-studio-lovely-rectangle">Class 2 Studio: Lovely Rectangle</h3>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">  /**
   * Filename: rectangle.c
   * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module1/studios/rectangle
   * 
   * Write a program that "draws" a rectangle made of hearts "&lt;3" on the console.
   * Your program should prompt the user for a width and a height, and then
   * print the corresponding rectangle.
   * 
   * Example:
   *    $ ./rectangle
   *    Width: 8
   *    Height: 3
   *    &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
   *    &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
   *    &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
   * 
   */</code></pre>
<h3 id="class-3-studio-repeat">Class 3 Studio: Repeat</h3>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">  /**
   * Filename: repeat.c
   * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module1/studios/repeat
   *
   * In a file called repeat.c write a program that repeats a phrase multiple times. 
   * You program should prompt the user for both a phrase, and a number of repeats.
   * 
   * Example:
   * $ ./repeat
   * Give me a phrase: I am NOT a talking robot!
   * How many times should I say it? 5
   * I am NOT a talking robot!
   * I am NOT a talking robot!
   * I am NOT a talking robot!
   * I am NOT a talking robot!
   * I am NOT a talking robot!
   * 
   * Twist 1: VALIDATE - Your program should only accept values that are at least 1, and no greater than 100 
   * for the "how many times" argument. If the user fails supply a number within that range, 
   * the program should continue prompting until they do.
   * 
   * Example:
   * $ ./repeat
   * Give me a phrase: Oh na na, what's my name.
   * How many times should I say it? (between 1 and 100): -4
   * How many times should I say it? (between 1 and 100): 238
   * How many times should I say it? (between 1 and 100): 2
   * Oh na na, what's my name.
   * Oh na na, what's my name.
   * 
   *

<h3 id="class-3-studio-dollars-and-cents">Class 3 Studio: Dollars and Cents</h3>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">  /**
   * Filename: dollarsandcents.c
   * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module1/studios/dollarsandcents
   *
   * Another useful function from &lt;math.h&gt; is round. This function takes a floating point number, 
   * and returns the nearest integer:
   * 
   *     int x = round(4.7);
   *     // the value of x is 5
   * 
   *     int y = round(4.4);
   *     // the value of y is 4 
   * 
   * Remember when your donut shop was charging customers crazy fractional dollar amounts, 
   * like $7.2494328374? Now we're able to do a better job in that sort of situation.
   * 
   * Write a program that prompts the user for a floating point dollar amount, 
   * and then tells them the actual dollar amount:
   * 
   * Example:
   * $ ./dollarsandcents
   * Gimme a dollar amount: 7.2494328374
   * Oh, I think you mean $7.250000000
   * (It still looks stupid because of the trailing 0s but thats ok. We'll learn how to fix that some other time.)
   *
   * Of course, in this case we do not want to round all the way down to the nearest integer. Doing so would have 
   * given us $7.00. Instead we want to round to the nearest 2 decimal places. Unfortunately, round isn't 
   * fancy enough to do that. But with a little bit of clever arithmetic, you can get around this no problem!
   * 
   * As a bonus, the work you do here will be very helpful for last section of Pset 1.
