                    <h1 id="how-to-submit-assignments">How to Submit Assignments</h1>
<p>All of your assignments (Studios and Problem Sets) will be submitted on Vocareum.  There is also an in-depth overview with screenshots on how to submit assignments in the Vocareum section of the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19HIMxU_RtVV0PcGpuL71KmAoQh-KTgyPGpWWLcmwo58/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Student Guide</a>. </p>
<h2 id="before-submitting-assignments">Before Submitting Assignments</h2>
<h5 id="naming-conventions">Naming Conventions</h5>
<p>When you submit your work on Vocareum it is very important to name your file correctly.  If the name of the file you submit is wrong you will not receive credit for the assignment.  Pay attention to all of the instructions provided for the assignment as well as on Vocareum.</p>
<h5 id="teams">Teams</h5>
<p>For some of the Assignments you will be able to submit your work as a team.  Even though you are allowed to work as a group, <strong><em>everyone is expected to complete and understand</em></strong> the assignment. </p>
<p>If the assignment allows submitting as a team, please make sure you consult with your peer(s) and that you all agree to submit as a team.  You will invite your peers on Vocareum and all of them should accept the invitation to participate.  Before finalizing your team, make sure that team member(s) are listed in the Assignment Section of Vocareum. You should also choose one person to send the invitations to your team member(s) and submit the work. We recommended that the same person does not submit all the time and when possible, try to work within different groups.</p>
<p>If you run into a problem when forming or joining a team, please reach out to us as soon as possible.</p>
<h5 id="problem-sets">Problem Sets</h5>
<p>Please make sure you use the <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/1/pset1/pset1.html#cs50_check" target="_blank"><b>check 50</b></a> tool in the cs50 IDE before you submit any Problem Sets that allow you to do so.  There will be instructions on how to use the tool for each Problem Set.</p>
<h5 id="studios">Studios</h5>
<p>When you are submitting Studios you should always use the inputs in the example to check your results against the results that are given in the Studio instructions. This will ensure you that have completed the assignment correctly.</p>
<p>Studio 1 Example:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./donuts
Welcome to the Loop Hole!
Today's Manager's Special is:
Crunch Jelly: A traditional jelly donut in which the jelly filling is made entirely of Capn' Crunch Berries (Just Berries)
How many would you like? 3.33333
How much would you like to pay per donut (suggested price is $4.35 each)? 2.5
Ok, let me prepare that for you....
After tax, your total is: $8.74999125
Thank you for snacking! Loop back around here soon!</code></pre>
<p>You would use 3.33333 and 2.5 as the inputs to validate that your result ($8.74999125) is the same. </p>
<ul>
<li>For this Studio your result may differ slightly due to imprecision.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submitting-assignments">Submitting Assignments</h2>
<p>You can login to <a href="https://labs.vocareum.com/home/login.php" target="_blank">Vocareum here</a>.  Select the appropriate assignment from your Student Dashboard (My Classes Page).</p>
<h5 id="individual-assignment">Individual Assignment</h5>
<p>If the assignment does not allow teams, you will see a my work button in the Submission Section of the page that you will click to be redirected to the page where you will submit your work. Read the instructions again (Instructions button on the top right corner of the screen),  upload your file, click the file to check that the work is accurate and submit.</p>
<h5 id="team-assignment">Team Assignment</h5>
<p>In the Submission section, you will have the choice to either Start Solo or to Send Invite.  If you are submitting the assignment yourself then you can choose Start Solo, else choose Send Invite and select the member of your group.  Repeat the process until you have sent all of the members of your team an invite, if it is allowed.
